We may share information with third-party service providers who perform services on our behalf, including cloud hosting and infrastructure providers, AI and machine learning processing services, payment processors, email delivery and communication services, analytics providers, workflow automation services, and customer support tools. These providers are contractually obligated to use your information only for the purposes of providing services to us and in compliance with this Privacy Policy.

A current list of our third-party service providers (sub-processors) is available upon request by contacting support@rockethub.ai.

### Team and Organizational Collaboration

If you are part of a team or organization using our services, certain information may be shared with other members of your team according to the permissions and settings configured by your organization's administrator.

### Legal Requirements

We may disclose information if required by law, subpoena, court order, or other legal process, or if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.

### Business Transfers

In connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization, sale of assets, or bankruptcy, your information may be transferred to the acquiring entity. We will provide notice before your personal information becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

## Third-Party Integrations

Our services may offer integrations with third-party platforms and services to enhance functionality. When you choose to connect a third-party service, you authorize us to access certain information from that service as permitted by your settings and that service's policies.

### What We Access

The specific data accessed depends on the integration and permissions you grant. This may include documents, files, emails, calendar information, or other data necessary to provide the integrated functionality you have requested.

### How We Use Integration Data

Data accessed through integrations is used solely to provide the features and services you have enabled. This may include reading and analyzing documents to provide AI-powered insights, synchronizing information between services, and creating or organizing content on your behalf when you request it. We do not use data from third-party integrations to train AI models, and we do not share this data with additional third parties except as necessary to provide the requested services.

### Managing Integrations

You control which integrations are active and can disconnect them at any time through your account settings. When you disconnect an integration, we stop accessing data from that service. You may also revoke access through the third-party service's own permission settings.

### Token and Credential Security

Access tokens and credentials for third-party services are encrypted and stored securely. We use industry-standard OAuth 2.0 protocols where available. These credentials are never exposed to your browser or other client applications.

## Data Storage and Security

We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your information, including secure cloud storage with reputable infrastructure providers, encryption of data in transit using SSL/TLS protocols, role-based access controls and authentication mechanisms, regular security assessments and monitoring, and regular backups for data recovery purposes.

We retain your data for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide services to you. Upon account deletion, we will delete or anonymize your personal information within a reasonable timeframe, except where retention is required by law or legitimate business purposes. For specific data retention schedules and deletion protocols, please refer to our Terms of Service.

## Your Rights and Choices

### Access and Correction

You can access and update your account information through your profile settings at any time.

### Data Deletion

## International Data Transfers

Your information may be transferred to and processed in countries other than your country of residence, including the United States, where our servers and service providers are located. These countries may have data protection laws that differ from those in your jurisdiction.

Where we transfer personal data from the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom, or Switzerland to countries that do not provide an adequate level of data protection, we rely on lawful transfer mechanisms such as the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (DPF), the UK Extension to the DPF, the Swiss-U.S. DPF, or Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) approved by the European Commission and entered into with our sub-processors.

## Data Protection Rights (GDPR)

If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom, or Switzerland, you have certain data protection rights under the General Data Protection Regulation and similar laws. These include the right to access your personal data, the right to correct inaccurate data, the right to delete your data ("right to be forgotten"), the right to restrict processing of your data, the right to data portability, the right to object to processing, and the right to withdraw consent at any time where processing is based on consent.

To exercise these rights, please contact us at support@rockethub.ai. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority.

## California Privacy Rights (CCPA/CPRA)

If you are a California resident, you have specific rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act and California Privacy Rights Act.

Reports, visualizations, and other outputs generated by the Service are stored within your account and may be exported in PDF format at any time.

Upon account termination or cancellation, your generated outputs will be retained for sixty (60) days, during which time you may export them. After this period, all generated outputs will be permanently deleted from our systems.

## AI Services

### AI Processing

- The Service uses AI to analyze your content and generate insights
- AI responses are generated automatically and may not always be accurate
- You are responsible for reviewing and verifying AI-generated content
- We do not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or reliability of AI responses

### Data Processing and Storage

To provide personalized and relevant AI-assisted responses, the Service processes and stores your content in a vectorized format within your account environment. This allows Astra to reference your data when generating responses.

Your data is not used to train the underlying AI models. The Service utilizes third-party AI providers (including Google Gemini and OpenAI) to generate responses. Your content is processed through these services to provide functionality but is not used to train or improve their foundational models. Your data remains siloed to your account and is not shared with or accessible by other users.

### AI-Generated Outputs

You retain ownership of any outputs generated by the Service that are derived from your content and data. You may use, modify, and commercialize such outputs for your business purposes.

You acknowledge that: (a) AI-generated content may not be eligible for copyright protection under applicable law; (b) similar structural formats, templates, or processes may be generated for other users; and (c) you are solely responsible for reviewing outputs and ensuring your use does not infringe any third-party rights.

We retain the right to use general processes, workflows, formats, and interface improvements derived from user interactions with the Service to improve our platform. We will not use your proprietary business data for any purpose other than providing the Service to you.

### AI Limitations and Responsible Use

The Service is designed to assist with business operations, insights, and recommendations. However, AI-generated outputs may contain errors, inaccuracies, or biases. You are responsible for reviewing, verifying, and exercising independent judgment before acting on any AI-generated content.

**Human Oversight Required.** You agree to maintain appropriate human oversight when using outputs from the Service, particularly for decisions involving financial commitments, legal matters, personnel actions, or other significant business decisions.

**Prohibited High-Risk Uses.** You may not use the Service for:

- Making employment decisions (hiring, termination, promotion) based solely on AI outputs
- Determining creditworthiness or financial eligibility
- Medical, legal, or professional advice in lieu of qualified professionals
